* Org-Mode and MathJax

Documentation to use and export LaTeX math formulas (and formulas from
extensions) from Org-Mode to HTML is sparse.
The most modern way of including formulas in HTML is by the use of MathJax.
Org-Mode has support for MathJax 2.7:
https://orgmode.org/manual/LaTeX-fragments.html.
It is a simple as including =#+OPTIONS: tex: t= in an org file.
Then, we can freely use LaTeX math formulas.

#+begin_src
#+OPTIONS: tex:t
$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
#+end_src

And this is the result:

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

* MathJax Extensions

Things get more complicated when trying to use formulas from LaTeX extensions.
One good extension when doing chemistry equations is =mhchem=. This can also be
used alongside MathJax, but we have to signal it that we want to use the
extension.

#+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank
Org-mode documentation [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Math-formatting-in-HTML-export.html][shows]] a way of “importing” an extension:, through the
following snippet:

#+begin_src
#+HTML_MATHJAX: cancel.js noErrors.js
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :target _blank
This is supposed to import “cancel” and “noErrors”. For some reason, it wasn’t
importing any of the extensions. One way of doing this would be [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/31271/siunitx-mathjax-org-mode-and-html-export][overriding]]
=org-html-mathjax-template= with the same value but with the extension key added.
But this solution is sub-optimal. Changing this configuration shouldn’t ever be
needed.
Fortunately, through the Org-Mode mailing list, an alternative was found:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2017-11/msg00030.html.
All that is needed is the following line on the top of the org file:

#+begin_src
#+HTML: \(\require{mhchem}\)
#+end_src

This is an indication to MathJax to import the required extension and is
converted to a =<script>= when the page is loading. The string might appear in
the page for a fraction of a second. This is the best solution that could be
found at this time, even though I have been having mixed results with it.

Here is an example:

#+begin_src
,#+HTML: \(\require{mhchem}\)
$$\ce{Hg^2+ ->[I-] HgI2->[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-}$$
#+end_src

And this is the result:

$$\ce{Hg^2+ ->[I-] HgI2->[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-}$$

There are other extensions that are not supported by MathJax and need an
alternative.
For instance, another chemistry related LaTeX library that can be used is =chemfig=,
which uses =tikz= internally. Since both of these libraries do not have
extensions to MathJax, a way of displaying it in HTML is generating a PNG
(=dvipng= or =imagemagick=) or an SVG (=dvisvgm=). I prefer =ImageMagick=
because of its easier to use.

#+begin_src
#+latex_header: \usepackage{chemfig}
#+OPTIONS: tex:imagemagick

$$\chemfig{H-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)-C(-[7]H)=[1]O}$$
#+end_src

This is the result:

[[./images/img1.png]]

* Export Settings

The result is far from good because the background may not match the websites
background, foreground the same and the image is trimmed without any padding.
To change how the image is generated, the =ImageMagick= command executed by
Org-Mode should be changed. The variable with configurations for =ImageMagick=,
=dvipng= and =dvisvgm= is =org-preview-latex-process-alist=.

The default command for =ImageMagick= is =convert -density %D -trim -antialias
%f -quality 100 %O=.
It is trimming the image completely, without adding any border. This can be
changed into: =convert -density %D -trim -border 10 -bordercolor white
-antialias %f -quality 100 %O=. The result is as follows:

[[./images/img2.png]]

* MathJax & Unsupported Extensions

Because of available and unavailable extensions for MathJax, there may be the
need to use both MathJax compatible formulas and images. Users may try to set
=#+OPTIONS: tex:t=, insert formulas and then set =#+OPTIONS: tex:imagemagick=
for images. But Org-Mode will only interpret the last option that has been set
when exporting (=imagemagick=). Because of this, all formulas will be images,
instead of having a mix of both. This seems to be a limitation of Org-Mode and
the workaround that is being used in this HTML page is setting =OPTIONS= to use
=t= (MathJax) and import manually the images for the other formulas that are not
compatible.

* A Javascript-less Method

If you are like me and you don’t want JavaScript polluting your website, there
is a method to generate images with =ImageMagick= that respect the website
background and you can use any background and foreground colors you want.

The LaTeX package =xcolor= is used to set the foreground color of the
equations/formulas, etc. It can also set the background color! As mentioned
before, a custom color can be set using =\definecolor= with an RGB input. Then, we
set the equation foreground color by putting =\color= before anything else. To
define the image background as transparent, we define =-transparent white= to the
output file in =ImageMagick=.

#+begin_src
#+latex_header: \usepackage{pagecolor}
#+latex_header: \usepackage{chemfig}
#+latex_header: \usepackage{xcolor}
#+latex_header: \definecolor{myForeground}{rgb}{0.9843, 0.9451, 0.7804}
#+latex_header: \definecolor{myBackground}{rgb}{0.1137,0.1255,0.1294}

$$\pagecolor{myBackground}\colorbox{myBackground}{\color{myForeground}\chemfig{CH_3CH_2-[:-60,,3]C(-[:-120]H_3C)=C(-[:-60]H)-[:60]C|{(CH_3)_3}}}$$
#+end_src

The LaTeX package =xcolor= can be used to set the background and foreground colors
of an equation, formula, etc. We can define new colors through the =\definecolor=
function, which takes an RGB input with values from =0.0= to =1.0=. To set the
background color, =\colorbox= is used and we set the background color as the first
argument, and we insert the formula as the second argument. To set the
foreground color, we prefix the formula field with the =\color= function.

The result is great, although there are two small thin grey lines on the top and
bottom of the generated image. To remove those lines, =\pagecolor= should be set
with the same color as the background of the image.

Additionally, I recommend adding a border to the result image. As mentioned
previously, this is the =ImageMagick= command, but with the same background color
as the website: =convert -density %D -trim -border 10 -bordercolor \"#1d2021\"
+repage -antialias %f -quality 100 %O=.

There is a second method if the previous one didn’t work. This may be the case
for normal math equations or other libraries.

#+begin_src
#+latex_header: \usepackage{pagecolor}
#+latex_header: \usepackage{xcolor}
#+latex_header: \definecolor{myForeground}{rgb}{0.9843, 0.9451, 0.7804}
#+latex_header: \definecolor{myBackground}{rgb}{0.1137,0.1255,0.1294}
#+latex_header: \newcommand{\highlight}[1]{\colorbox{myBackground}{$\displaystyle #1$}}

$$\pagecolor{myBackground}\highlight{\color{myForeground}S0(x)=(x >>> 2)\oplus(x >>> 13)\oplus(x >>> 22)}$$
#+end_src

[[./images/img4.png]]

This second method was provided by a user in StackOverflow: https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/33402.
