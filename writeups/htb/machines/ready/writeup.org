Starting with nmap, we get the following output:

This nmap output is very informative. There is an HTTP server on port =5080=.
and there is some information in =http-robots.txt=, which tells us some existing
directories. There is also a login page in http://10.10.10.220:5080/users/sign_in.

The link redirects to a GitLab login page where we can register.
When we register, we go to the dashboard. From here, we can also check which
version of GitLab is running in the server. The version is =11.4.7=.
We can immediately check that there are some Authenticated RCE exploits in =Exploit DB=.
